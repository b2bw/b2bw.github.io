Unfortunately, we are not able to release all rescued orangutans back into the wild. Many are physically disabled or mentally unsuitable and cannot attend Forest School. It was always clear to us that it should not be their fate to spend the rest of their lives in a cage.
Â 
BOS has set itself the goal of becoming the world's first rescue centre without cages for healthy orangutans. Therefore, we are building forested islands where our orangutans can live in small groups. We have already built 15 islands separated by canals. Up to 300 orangutans now spend a dignified life in a natural and species-appropriate environment.

Even with this progress, we still need more islands. Our work for orangutans with no hope of returning to the wild has only just begun. We urgently need donations for the construction of additional islands.

Please support our mission to enable orangutans that cannot be reintroduced into the wild to live outside cages!
